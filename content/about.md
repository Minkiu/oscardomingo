My name is Oscar (he/him), I am a Software Engineer, who worked mostly in the the Visual Effects industry, where Python is the most prevalent language using the Qt framework to create UIs.

I was a front-end developer before jumping onto the Visual Effects and I have started to get interested in Rust recently (2024).

I go by the alias "minkiu", so if you find a profile with that handle and an owl as profile picture, chances are it's me, that said you can find me in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscardomingoramos/), [Github](https://github.com/Minkiu), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@minkiu) (I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/minkiu) too, but I have been more active in the fediverse, join us!).
