   <h2 class="block__subtitle"> What </h2><br>
   A blog, that will support my personal portoflio. Which is built with a Static Webpage Generator called <a href="https://gohugo.io/" class="block_link block__link--p">Hugo</a>, with a custom template created by me specificly for this site, using paper and pencil, html, sass and javascript. I consider this website a ongoing project, and I am launching it being aware thats it's not complete.
  </p>
  <p class="block__text">
  I intend to write irregulary in topics that span from web development to cgi, including Linux and updates of my current projects.
 </p>
  <p class="block__text">
<h2 class="block__subtitle"> Why </h2><br>
   I always wanted to have a blog, never knew what to talk about, cause sometimes it's hard to focus on a topic. <br>
   Why Hugo? I had to help a friend with a Jekyll website, and start diggin in the Static Content Generators, and Hugo peaked my curiosity, and I though it would be cool to learn something new.

 <p class="block__text">
  <h2 class="block__subtitle"> When </h2><br>
  Irregular. I don't want to set a minimum post cause writing is not what I pursue.
