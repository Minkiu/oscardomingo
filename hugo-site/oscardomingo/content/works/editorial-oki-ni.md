  Since we migrated from another platform (at <a href="https://www.oki-ni.com" class="block__link block__link--p">oki-ni</a>), we had to rethink how to keep the blog section we had in the old website, and that Demandware doesn't support by default.

    <li>Wordpress (PHP) and Plugins</li>

 <p class="block__text">
  So we concluded that a blog built with Wordpress would fit our needs, and so, I developed a bespoke template for what we today know as Editorial at <a href="http://editorial.oki-ni.com" class="block__link block__link--p">editorial.oki-ni.com</a>
 </p>


  <p class="block__text">
The main page is a Masonry (<a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/" class="block__link block__link--p">Desandro's</a>) grid, with a infinite scroll and lazy loading plugin.
 </p>
  <p class="block__text">
  The site makes use of custom post types for each section of the blog, allowing more freedom on the look of each of them.
 </p>

 
  <p class="block__text">
 The site is constantly going under changes to try improve the speed loads and the usability of it.
