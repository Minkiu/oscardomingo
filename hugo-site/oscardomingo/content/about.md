     <br>
     I was born and raised in Barcelona, studied Uni (Multimedia Degree) in Barcelona, and after a while working as full stack developer in a small company, I decided to take the leap to London, where I decide to increase my skillset by studying a course of 3D for visual effects. I don't like to label myself in one field (web dev) or the other (cgi), since I enjoy both a lot.
