# About

This is the repo for my personal site: https://www.oscardomingo.eu

## Contents

- **App** Folder: Original html files, there is where the gulpfile.js looks for files, and process them.
- **hugo-site**: site structure of an hugo site, inside the public folder you can find the actual website and in the theme one it's my ported html to hugo-theme.


## To-Do
- Currently the *gulp build* command won't work, since I get an error on the userref pipeline, so the css ain't minimized.
- Work out a better design for the titles.
