# About
This is the repo for my personal site: https://www.oscardomingo.com

## Contents

- **index.html** main file with the actual site.
- **static** main folder with styles.css and fonts

## To Do
 Convert the site to a [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) website and add the blog (and RSS) section.

## Credits
Spectral font - https://github.com/productiontype/spectral
Nanum Gothic Font - https://github.com/naver/nanumfont
I downloaded them from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) and used [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org/) to generate the WOFF and WOFF2 files.
