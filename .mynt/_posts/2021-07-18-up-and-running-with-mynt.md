So I finally got around setting up a blog on my personal site, and I did it with `mynt` (https://mynt.uhnomoli.com/), a simple, lean and to the point static site generator written in Python, you can see the code here: <github page>

I followed the Quickstart guide (https://mynt.uhnomoli.com/docs/quickstart/) and I adapted the html and CSS from my live site, into `mynt`, I changed a bit the CSS, removing crust and using a simpler CSS reset (https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/), and implement CSS for the new pages.

So far the experience is good, will keep you posted.
